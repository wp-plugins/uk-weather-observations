The UK Weather Observations plugin for WordPress displays recent local UK weather observations based on RSS feeds published by the BBC.

== Description ==

The UK Weather Observations plugin for WordPress displays recent local UK weather observations based on RSS feeds published by the BBC. Please see the <a href="http://www.clive-publishing.com/2009/01/uk-weather-observations-plugin-for-wordpress/" title="UK Weather Observations">UK Weather Observations web page</a> for more information.

= Features =

* Displays local weather information, updated regularly during daylight hours; 
* Weather information is sourced from the BBC; 
* Weather information is updated automatically; 
* Admin interface to select locality and customize settings; 
* WordPress Widget enabled; 
* Written specifically for WordPress 2.7; 
* No PHP skills or file changes are required; 
* And more!

== Installation ==

1. Extract the files from the uk-weather-observations .zip archive.
2. Upload the complete plugin folder /uk-weather-observations/, contained in the .zip file, to your WordPress plugin directory.
3. Go to your WordPress Admin panel -> Plugins and activate the UK Weather Observations plugin.
4. (If required) Go to Appearance -> Widgets and add the UK Weather Observations widget to the sidebar.

To put the weather observations information at any place on a post or page, use this shortcode:
[uk-wops]

= Configuration =

The plugin is pre-configured by default to display recent weather observations for Marazion, Cornwall. To change this:
 
1. Go to WP-Admin -> Settings -> UK Weather Observations.
2. Enter the BBC location code for the location that you are interested in.
3. Click on 'Save Changes' to save the new location and update the weather information for it.

No other configuration is normally required.

To find your BBC location code, go to www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml and search for your nearest town or large village.

If the search is successful, your BBC location code is the 4 digit number at the end of the URL. For example, if you search for 'Marazion', the search result URL is http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml?id=3737 - the BBC location code is 3737.

If the search is not successful, you are given the option of a post code search, which will give similar results, but does not always seem to choose the closest weather observation.

== Support ==
